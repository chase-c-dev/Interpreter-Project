# Interpreter-Project
Organization of Programming Languages Project that creates a mini programming language

The program evaluates user entered expressions just as a programming language would by using parser, lexer and evaluater logic.
Every user entered command is tokenized and the tokens for the expressions are what is used to parse, lex and evaluate.

Here Are Some Test Cases
Your project needs to get correct results from the test cases like the below:

1 * ( 2 + 5 )

The result is: 7

(1 + 2) * 5 + 4

The result is: 19

23 * ((1 + 5) * 33)

The result is: 4554

5 â€“ 13 / 21 + 21 * 6

The result is: 130.38095238095238

24

The result is: 24

125

The result is: 125

-5

The result is: -5

--5 

The result is: 5

-(-5)

The result is: 5

-5 + 6 * 19

The result is: 109
